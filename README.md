# Instacart
Data analysis project for the Instacart online grocery store

## Instacart Project Brief

### Context
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. My task as an analyst is to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My analysis will help the sales team with their targeted marketing strategy and ensure that their ad campaigns are effective.

### Key Questions
These are the key questions that the sales team would like to know about the Instacart customers:
- What are the busiest days of the week and the busiest hours of the day? 
- What are the times of day when people spend the most money?
- Is there a way to use simpler price range groupings?
- Are there certain types of products that are more populars than others?
- What are the different types of customers and their ordering behaviours?
- Can we find differences in ordering habits based on a customer's brand loyalty, their geographical region, family status and other demographic classifications?

### Data set
The data set is from the following website [Kaggle Instacart](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis) with additional data fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purposes of this project.
